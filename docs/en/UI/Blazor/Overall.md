# Blazor UI: Overall

## Introduction

[Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/) is a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET. It is promising for a .NET developer that you can create Single-Page Web Applications using C# and the Razor syntax.

ABP provides infrastructure and integrations that make your Blazor development even easier, comfortable and enjoyable.

This document provides an overview for the ABP Framework Blazor UI integration and highlights some major features.

### Getting Started

You can follow the documents below to start with the ABP Framework and the Blazor UI now:

* [Get started](../../Getting-Started.md) with the Blazor UI for the ABP Framework.
* [Web Application Development Tutorial](../../Tutorials/Part-1.md) with the Blazor UI.

## Modularity

[Modularity](../../Module-Development-Basics.md) is one of the key goals of the ABP Framework. It is not different for the UI; It is possible to develop modular applications and reusable application modules with isolated and reusable UI pages and components.

The [application startup template](../../Startup-Templates/Application.md) comes with some application modules pre-installed. These modules have their own UI pages embedded into their own NuGet packages. You don't see their code in your solution, but they work as expected on runtime.
